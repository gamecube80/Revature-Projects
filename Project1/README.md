MovieLens data sets were collected by the GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota. This data set consists of: * 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies. * Each user has rated at least 20 movies. * Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip) Should Import csv data about movies and their ratings into HDFS, then create tables from the imported files in Hive. Once imported, should create queries to analyze and display data about the movies and their ratings.

Project 1 was a scala project to use the CLI to use different commands to get different queries from a hive database.
Each different querie has at least 1 user defined variable.
This allows the user to get many different search results depeinding on what they want to find.
